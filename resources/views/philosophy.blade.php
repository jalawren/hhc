    <h3>Health Philosophy</h3>

    <p>
    Being healthy in America isn’t easy.  We’re bombarded with advertising tempting us to eat juicy burgers, crisp bacon, and hot fudge sundaes.  Fast food restaraunts are everywhere, trying to lure us in for a double cheeseburger, large fries, and a milkshake.  You’ve had a long day at the office.  You’re tired and hungry.  You don’t want to cook and bother with cleaning up.  It’s so easy to just swing by Burger King and get a cheap dinner for $5.  I’m sure you’ve driven by a Burger King and smelled their flame broiled, smoky goodness.  It’s tough to pass up these foods when you’re tired, stressed, and short on time.  The whole process of ordering and eating takes less than 20 minutes.  It tastes great and makes you happy (temporarily anyway).  Why bother with cooking for 30 minutes and cleaning up after yourself when you could just let Taco Bell, McDonald’s, or Pizza Hut do it for you?  I’m not exaggerating when I say that ninety percent of my diet was fast food when I was in my twenties.   The other ten percent was Captain Crunch and Mike and Ikes.  It’s no mystery why I was seventy pounds overweight.  Believe me, I understand how easy it is to fall into the trap of short term gratification when it comes to food.   The good news is that eating healthier isn’t as hard you think.  With a little preparation and thought on the weekend, you don’t have to spend hours in the kitchen during the work week.  The trick is to ease your way into it so it’s not overwhelming and so you can sustain the behavior.  I can help teach you how but that’s another conversation for another time….

    Try this sometime.  Next time you’re at Speedway, Pilot, or any gas station for that matter, take a look around.  What do you see?  Beer, cigarettes, candy, pizza, lottery, fountain drinks, chewing tobacco, potato chips, coffee, and those weird, crispy egg roll looking things that look like they’ve been sitting there since George Bush was president.  These places are in the business of selling addictions.  Their goal is to separate you from your money.  Unfortunately, the products they’re selling can also separate you from good health.  One general piece of advice I give people is to eat food, not products.  Many products are designed to get you hooked.  There are men and women in white lab coats working diligently to figure out just the right amount of sugar, fat, or salt to get you hooked.   Some of them even tell you up front, “bet you can’t eat just one.”  It’s pretty easy to eat one apple or one cucumber, not so easy to eat one potato chip.

    The food we put into our body is only one aspect of health.  Granted, it’s a very important part of being a healthy person but there are other things to consider as well.  Relationships, career, sleep, exercise and stress all play critical roles in determining our level of health.  For example, let’s say you know someone who eats pretty well most of the time, goes to the gym 5 days a week and has a nice physique.  But, they hate their job, are going through a nasty divorce, and  aren’t sleeping well because they’re so stressed out.   This person looks great on the outside but they’re suffering on the inside.

    Good health starts in the mind.  In order to improve your health, you first need to decide that improving your health is worth your time and effort.   Once you decide it’s worth your time and effort, you need to decide how you’re going to improve your health.  Where do you start?  Is it joining a gym, eating more fruits and vegetables, reducing your stress, starting a meditation practice, or improving the quality of your sleep?  There are many ways to improve your health.  It’s also important to understand why you want to improve your health.  Do you want to be at a healthier weight, get off of cholesterol medication, improve your fitness, have a better sex life, or improve your energy levels?  Maybe you want all of those things.  The point is that before you’ve eaten a piece of fruit, lifted a weight, or hopped on a treadmill, you’ve already started the process of improving your health by thinking about how and why you’d like to do so.  My role is to be your partner in the process and to show you ways to incorporate healthier habits into your life.  Not all at once, but over time in ways that aren’t stressful to you.

    My philosophy of health focuses on habit change.  How, when, and where can you incorporate healthier habits into your life?  We’ll figure that out together depending on your goals and do it in a way that fits into your life.   We’ll start small and make the necessary adjustments as time goes on.  There is no “one size fits all” plan for this.  Everyone is different and we’ll work together to find out what works best for you.  This process isn’t about getting the right amount of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins.  It isn’t about going to the gym or running 3 days a week.  First and foremost, this about process is about changing your mindset.   Opening yourself up to a new way of thinking about your health and happiness is the primary focus.  Building a strong foundation of health and happiness takes time.  There are no quick fixes but it doesn’t have to be painful either.  Dare I say that it can actually be fun.  It takes time to change.  You can do it.  I can help.
