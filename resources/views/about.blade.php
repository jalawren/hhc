            Who am I?  Before I go any further, stop here and ask yourself the same question.  Take your time; I'll step outside for a quick smoke while you think about it.  I may be a health coach, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy a delicious Marlboro once in a while, am I right?

            What answers did you come up with?  Are you a parent, employee, or spouse?  Are you healthy or unhealthy?  Are you financially well off, middle class, or do you struggle to make ends meet?  Are you happy?  These are all examples of how people define themselves.  You neighbor may describe himself as a happily married father of two.  He may be a lawyer who also enjoys golfing, reading, watching movies, and going out with his wife on Saturday nights.  He might volunteer at a local soup kitchen once a month.  He might be reasonably healthy but would like to drop ten pounds or so.  He may describe himself as upper-middle class.  I would suggest that these things don't describe who he actually is.  Who we are goes much deeper than the things we do to occupy our time.

            So who am I?  I'm intelligent, creative, passionate, curious, and talented.  You may be thinking, "Geez, this guy really thinks highly of himself.  He only listed good things to describe who he is."  This isn't true though. Our brains are conditioned to think of these things as positive attributes.  The words I used to describe myself aren't good or bad.  These traits are merely tools that can be used in different ways.  Intelligence, creativity, and passion can be used to compose a beautiful piece of music.  Or, they can be used to orchestrate an elaborate bank robbery or a Ponzi scheme.  Bernie Madoff is intelligent and creative.  Sadly, he used his intelligence and creativity to steal millions of dollars from clients who put their trust in him.

            I am also an addict.  To varying degrees, I think we are all hardwired for addiction.  If something tastes good or feels good, we want more.  I’ve been addicted to marijuana, cigarettes, fast food, sugar, television, and prescription pills (by the way, I was kidding about the smoke break earlier.  I quit my three pack a day habit fifteen years ago).  Being an addict isn't necessarily good or bad.  Just like we are conditioned to think of intelligence and creativity  as positives, we are also conditioned to think of addiction as a negative.  Don't get me wrong, addiction can be a terrible thing and it has destroyed countless lives.  But, if one can focus their addictive tendencies in a positive direction, great things can happen.  Addiction can work for us and against us.  Addiction can be good or bad at the same time.   Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant are addicted to competition.  The drive to win at all cost has earned them millions of dollars.  That same drive has alienated them from teammates at times and damaged relationships in their lives.  Jimi Hendrix, Jack Kerouac, Truman Capote and Prince were all addicts who produced amazing works of art. However, addiction ended up costing all of them their lives much too early.

            So I'm an intelligent, creative, passionate, curious, and talented addict.   As a teenager I was curious how it would feel to take two hits of LSD.  I was curious what it felt like to snort Ritalin and smoke marijuana.  As an adult, I was curious what it would feel like to run a 50 mile ultra-marathon. I was curious how it would feel to switch from a meat based diet to a mostly plant based diet.  As it turns out, switching to a mostly plant based diet felt great and I was able to get off of my blood pressure and cholesterol medications as a result.  I didn’t just wake up one day and make the switch.  I was patient and gradually eased into it over time.  In my twenties, I was intelligent and creative in the ways I was able to get the drugs I needed. I was passionate about my drinking and drugging.   Now that in my early forties, I use my intelligence and passion more wisely.  I’m intelligent in choosing what habits to integrate into my life.  I’m passionate about developing my mental and physical fitness.  I use my creativity to write and play music.

            Who I am is not what I do.  Jobs, relationships, finances, and health are all subject to change.  Right now, I'm healthy and in good enough shape to run a marathon on any given week.  That wasn't the case ten years ago and that may not be the case ten years from now.  I'm not a "healthy marathon runner,"  it's not who I am, it's just one of the things I do at this time. If you would have told me twenty years ago when I was smoking pot, cigarettes, eating fast food, not exercising, and watching TV on a daily basis that I would one day be a health coach who runs forty miles a week, I would have thought you were insane.  The addictions I had in my twenties were serious, I was hospitalized because of them. On the surface, it looks like I'm an entirely different person than I was twenty years ago.  But I'm not, I have the same traits now as I did then.  The difference is that I've been able to train my brain over the years to develop habits that work for me, not against me.   I would love to help you learn to use all of your natural talents to help you achieve the level of health and happiness that you want in your life.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.
