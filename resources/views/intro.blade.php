            I am a Certified Health Coach based in Burlington, KY.  My goal is to help people improve their health and happiness through sustainable habit change.  Diets and quick fixes don’t work.  People often make the mistake of trying to do too much, too soon.  They can change their behavior for a short amount of time but the change doesn’t last and they go back to their old habits.  My approach focuses on making small habit changes that aren’t overwhelming or overly stressful.  Over time, these small changes add up and can transform your life.
